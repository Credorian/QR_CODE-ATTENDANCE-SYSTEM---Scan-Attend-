Import Libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. qrcode is imported to generate QR codes, and os is imported to perform file system operations.

Function Definition: The code defines a function generate_qr_code that takes two parameters: name (the data to be encoded in the QR code) and folder_path (the path to the folder where the QR code image will be saved).

QR Code Generation: Inside the generate_qr_code function, a QR code object qr is created using the QRCode class from the qrcode library. The version, error correction level, box size, and border size are specified for the QR code. The data (name) is added to the QR code using the add_data method, and the QR code is generated using the make method with the fit=True parameter to fit the QR code to the data size.

Folder Creation: The code checks if the specified folder (folder_path) exists. If the folder doesn't exist, it is created using os.makedirs(folder_path, exist_ok=True).

QR Code Image Creation: The QR code image is created using the make_image method of the qr object. The fill_color parameter specifies the color of the QR code, and the back_color parameter specifies the background color.

Save QR Code Image: The QR code image is saved in the specified folder using the save method. The os.path.join(folder_path, "qr_code.png") function constructs the full path for the QR code image, combining the folder path with the file name "qr_code.png".

Print Confirmation Message: Finally, a confirmation message is printed to indicate that the QR code has been generated successfully and saved in the specified folder.

Function Call: The function generate_qr_code is called with the name "John Doe" and the specified folder path where the QR code image will be saved.

MAKE SURE THAT YOU CREATE THE NAME IN THE QR_CODE AS SAME AS THE NAME THAT YOU ENTER IN THE ATTENDANCE_LIST DICTIONARY IN THE SCANATTEND FILE SO AS THE NAME MATCHES AND IT GETS UPDATED ALSO IN THE DB
